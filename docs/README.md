## Quick Links

### For New Developers
1. Start with the [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)
2. Read through [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) for full details
3. Explore the codebase starting from `context/ContentView.swift`

### For Contributors
1. Understand the [Architecture](./architecture.md)
2. Study the SwiftUI views in `context/Views/`
3. See open issues on GitHub

### For Users
1. See the main [README](../README.md) for features
2. Check [releases](https://github.com/tartavull/context/releases) for downloads

## Key Concepts

### Recursive Task Decomposition
The core innovation - breaking complex tasks into focused subtasks to maintain optimal LLM performance.

### Execution Modes
- **Interactive**: User participates in the conversation
- **Autonomous**: Runs without intervention (planned)

### Context Isolation
Each task maintains its own conversation context to prevent degradation.

## Technology Stack

- **SwiftUI**: Native macOS user interface
- **Swift 6.0**: Modern Swift with concurrency features
- **MVVM Architecture**: Reactive state management with ObservableObject
- **Native macOS**: Optimized for macOS ecosystem integration

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Native macOS app with SwiftUI interface
- Project and task management system
- Visual task tree representation
- Conversation data models and UI
- Reactive state management

### ðŸš§ In Development
- AI integration (LLM API calls)
- Task decomposition logic
- Streaming conversation responses

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Autonomous task execution
- Multi-model LLM support
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Native macOS integrations (Spotlight, Shortcuts)
