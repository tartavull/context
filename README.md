# Orchestrator

**Recursive Task Decomposition for Optimal LLM Performance**

Orchestrator is a next-generation AI task management system that addresses the fundamental limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations. By employing recursive task decomposition, Orchestrator maintains short, focused conversations that maximize LLM effectiveness.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Defeats Context Degradation**: Each conversation stays short and focused
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Multiple tasks advance simultaneously  
- **Interactive & Autonomous Modes**: Jump in exactly where your expertise is needed
- **Visual Task Tree**: Real-time visualization of task decomposition
- **Continuous Learning**: Built-in prompt improvement system

## 📖 Documentation

For detailed information about the architecture, implementation, and roadmap, please see our [full documentation](doc/README.md).

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Research shows that LLMs exhibit a **39% performance drop** in multi-turn conversations. Orchestrator solves this by keeping each LLM interaction within its optimal performance zone through recursive task decomposition.
